# 3-Stage-BJT-Amplifier
3-stage BJT amplifier consisting of 2 CE amplifiers and a CC amplifier with a no-load and load gain of 50.

## Specifications
- +10V power supply
- Quiescent current drawn from the power supply must be no larger than 10mA
- No-load gain at 1KHz should be |A<sub>vo</sub>| = 50 (&plusmn;10%)
- Input resistance should be no smaller than 20k&ohm; at 1KHz
- Maximum no-load output voltage swing at 1KHz should be no smaller than 8V peak-to-peak
- Maximum loaded output voltage swing at 1Khz and R<sub>L</sub> = 1K&ohm; should be no smaller than 4V peak-to-peak
